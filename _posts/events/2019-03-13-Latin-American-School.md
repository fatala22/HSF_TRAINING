Welcome to the 10th CERN Latin-American School of High-Energy Physics (CLASHEP2019).

The 2019 School will take place from 13 to 26 March 2019 in Villa General Belgrano, CÃ³rdoba Province, Argentina.

**Academic Programme:**

There will be about 32 lectures, each lasting about 90 minutes including time for questions. These will be complemented by parallel group discussion sessions most afternoons. There will be an evening poster session during which all students are invited to present their research work. In addition, there will be group project work based on the detailed study of published experimental data analyses. The timetable will be available soon. The scientific programme can be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/763013/page/14975-scientific-programme).

**Who can apply**

The CERN Latin-American School of High-Energy Physics is targeted particularly at students in experimental HEP who are in the final years of work towards their PhDs. However, it is anticipated that some post-doctoral students in experimental HEP, and some students in phenomenology, including some masters students, will also be accepted. It should be noted that some pre-knowledge of the subjects is necessary in order to be able to profit fully from the lecture courses.

Demand for attendance at the School exceeds the number of available places, so a competitive selection is made based on information provided on the application form and the letter of recommendation from the student's professor or supervisor.

The School is open to qualified candidates of any nationality. Sponsorship may be available to cover the fees, and in some cases also the travel expenses, of selected Latin-American students where it is not possible to obtain support from other sources.
